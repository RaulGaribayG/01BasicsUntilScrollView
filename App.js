      Views are used to build boxes and containers that hold other core components, are like the equivalents
      to divs in web development, but to show something inside of a View it needs to be into an element
      that is able to display it.

      style prop is used to put some style but is not supported by all the components.
      View and Text are components which support style prop. 

      Also we can write our styles in line but that means it wouldn't be reusable, so it isn't recommendable.
      So it's better to use a StyleSheet object, so we can make our styles reusable.

            We can use map to do this but just when we aren't using FlatList, because the task would be now passed to FlatList
            so it can render the list efficiently by only rendering what's neeeded.

            Also, it's necessary put the style inside a view because otherwise part of the style will be missing on iOS devices,
            not every time this would happen, but sometimes its necessary make little adjustments to our code to look the same
            in both Android and iOS.
